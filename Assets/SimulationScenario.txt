You are currently commuting to work on a packed morning train, running behind schedule after a long, sleepless night.
As your train approaches your stop, your phone buzzes.
This is your last chance. If you are late one more time, your employment will be terminated immediately due to poor attendance. No exceptions.
You quickly check the time. You have exactly 10 minutes to clock inâ€”and the clock is already ticking.
You remember that you're already on thin ice after missingmultiple shifts last month.
Getting fired today would mean losing your income, your health insurance, and possibly your apartment.
As the train slows into the station, you brace yourself to move quickly, hoping nothing delays you.
